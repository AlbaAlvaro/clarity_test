## Description
To solve the requirements of the document, I have worked in a Jupyter Notebook with **Python**.

Exercise 1 is solved in the first part of the notebook, and the part of Exercise 2 that I was able to code is below Exercise 1.

## How it works
Exercise 1:
- initial_datetime: is the initial time in timestamp format that should be given to the query.
- end_datetime: is the final time of the period in timestamp format that will be given to the query.
- to_host: the given host to which the oher hosts will be connected.

## Future improvements
Create the unlimited input parser having into account that it should be a memory-efficient solution.
